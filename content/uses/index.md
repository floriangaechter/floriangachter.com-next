# Uses

I like to browse other people's "uses" pages, so I decided to write my own.
Here's a list of hardware and software I'm using. Enjoy!

## Hardware

- MacBook Pro 14-inch, 2021 with Apple M1 Pro
- ThinkPad T480 for when I'm dabbling in Linux
- [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) keyboard (currently)

## Software

I like to self-host as much as possible. A good example is Bitwarden, which I
use with Vaultwarden. These are a couple of tools I use most often:

- Password manager: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) (+ [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden))
- Launcher: [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
- Terminal: [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) + [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- Browser: Usually I use [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com). But recently, I
  decided to try out [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/). So far it has stuck.
- Editor: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
