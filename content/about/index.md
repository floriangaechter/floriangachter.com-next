# A brief introduction

My name is Florian Gächter and I'm the creator of this blog. I started this
blog to share things I've come across, that I think might help others.

I've always been interested in technology and have been a developer for
around 17 years.

In my free time, I enjoy the outdoors and spending time with my family. I'm
also really into home automation. Mainly because I'm lazy and hate manually
turning lights on and off…

On this blog, you'll find a collection of my thoughts, experiences, and advice
on things relating to my interests. I hope you find my posts something that's
worth your time. Thanks for reading!
