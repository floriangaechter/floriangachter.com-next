I recently decided to move my blog from Netlify to Uberspace. It ultimately came down to data sovereignty. With what&rsquo;s going on in the US, all the AI bullshit you have to deal with when using platforms like Netlify, it just didn&rsquo;t sit right with me anymore.
But beyond the geographical change, Uberspace offers me almost complete shell access and control over my hosting environment. Even though my blog is just a static site built with Astro, having this level of control means I can make adjustments whenever I need to." />
