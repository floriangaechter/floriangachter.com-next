  <h1 id="uberspace">Uberspace</h1>
<p>I recently decided to move my blog from <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to
<a href="https://uberspace.de">Uberspace</a>. It ultimately came down to data sovereignty.
With what&rsquo;s going on in the US, all the AI bullshit you have to deal with when
using platforms like Netlify, it just didn&rsquo;t sit right with me anymore.</p>
<p>But beyond the geographical change, Uberspace offers me almost complete shell
access and control over my hosting environment. Even though my blog is just a
static site built with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>, having this level of
control means I can make adjustments whenever I need to.</p>
<p>Another thing I really like about Uberspace is its transparent pricing model.
Their pay-what-you-want approach means users can decide what&rsquo;s fair compensation
and what&rsquo;s within their means. Additionally, I feel like their values really
align with my own.</p>
<p>Moving away from US-based hosting also means a conscious step towards reducing
my dependence on American tech infrastructure. The monthly cost I now pay is a
small price for a good feeling.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about data sovereignty and privacy, especially in today&rsquo;s
geopolitical environment, considering European alternatives to US-based hosting
makes sense (at least to me). My transition to Uberspace wasn&rsquo;t just a technical
decision—it was a statement about the kind of internet and by extension, world I
want to support.</p>
<p>Of course moving from a set-it-and-forget-it solution like Netlify meant, that I
couldn&rsquo;t take advantage of their build pipeline anymore, so I had to set up
something custom with Gitub Actions. I might update this post in the future
about how I managed to build and sync the site to Uberspace on pushes to the
main branch.</p>
