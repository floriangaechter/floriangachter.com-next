<p>For as long as I can remember, I&rsquo;ve been relying on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a> as my trusty code editors. These tools have served me well over the years, becoming like my old reliable pair of shoes. Recently, though, I&rsquo;ve been aware that my mental gears aren&rsquo;t running quite as smoothly as they once did. Not surprising, as aging tends to have that effect on people.</p>

<p>To offset this and add some stimulation to my routine, I decided to try something completely new. Step one? I switched my keyboard to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqpBKuEVinw">Sweep variant</a>. Admittedly, this wasn&rsquo;t an easy leap. The layout is unfamiliar, and my typing speed has slowed down considerably. But interestingly, this additional challenge is proving to be enjoyable. More than that, it demands a level of mental engagement that I find quite refreshing.</p>

<p>My curiosity didn&rsquo;t stop there. I wanted to see what other changes I could implement in my workflow. I remembered <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux">tmux</a> from the <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/upcase">Upcase</a> series by <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot</a> I had stumbled upon years ago. I tried classic Vim back then, but it felt overly complicated and a bit intimidating. However, in keeping with my new approach, I decided it was time to revisit these tools, this time focusing on <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>.</p>

<p>To lessen the steep learning curve, I chose <a href="https://www.lazyvim.org/">Lazyvim</a> as my starting point for Neovim. Why? Well, I thought about building my own configuration from the ground up, but I decided it&rsquo;s better to have a solid foundation from which I can piece things together. After all, rushing headlong into unfamiliar territory without understanding the basics seemed counterproductive.</p>

<p>And what about tmux? I really like the concept of converting my terminal into a &ldquo;desktop&rdquo;. Taking time to read through &ldquo;<a href="https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux/read">The Tao of tmux</a>&rdquo; helped me understand its real value—and it clicked. Trying tmux seemed like the next logical step in this journey of exploration.</p>

<p>How long will I stick with this new setup? I can&rsquo;t say for sure, maybe a week or maybe longer. But the time frame isn&rsquo;t really the point here. This is about embracing change, learning new things, and keeping my mind engaged. Everything else is simply an added perk. And before you ask, yes, this entire post was composed in Neovim. It took longer, sure, but you know what? It was a fun and satisfying experience!</p>
